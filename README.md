My name is Taher Alfayad. I am a Computer Science Graduate from the University of Central Florida, where I am also employed as an Applications Programmer II. 

I have a portfolio website where I go into detail about myself, my career, and most of the projects that I've worked on in my life, hosted [here](https://taheralfayad.com)!

A few fun facts about me are that I am very passionate about educational technology, data engineering, data visualization, and AI/ML, and would love to one day create an open-source project that the community finds useful.

That's all about me for now, hope you enjoy going through my projects!
